			<h1 id="birth">Birth and Childhood</h1>
			<div class="birth">
			<p>Luffy was born in Foosha Village to Monkey D. Dragon and an unknown woman. Dragon left Luffy in the care of his grandfather, Monkey D. Garp, who did many dangerous things to Luffy to make him stronger, like throwing him down a deep ravine, leaving him alone in the wild, and tying him to a balloon<br><br>

			Shanks and the Red Hair Pirates established a base in Foosha Village when Luffy was 6 years old. Their sniper Yasopp regularly informed Luffy while they were there that he had a kid named Usopp who was about his age.  Luffy stabbed himself beneath his left eye to demonstrate that he was tough enough to be a pirate in order to join the Red Hair Pirates after they had been in the village for about a year.

			<h1 id="family">Luffy's New Family: Bandits and Brothers</h1>
			<p>After the Red Hair Pirates left, Garp took Luffy to Mt. Colubo and placed him in the care of the mountain bandit Curly Dadan and the Dadan Family. He introduced Luffy to Dadan's other ward Portgas D. Ace, but Ace was cold toward Luffy. Every day, Ace would travel away from the Dadan Family hideout, and Luffy attempted to follow him. Ace would put obstacles in his path to stop him, but Luffy continued following him.<br><br>

			Eventually, Luffy made it to Gray Terminal, where he found Ace counting money with a boy named Sabo. When Luffy went up to them, Ace and Sabo captured him and talked about killing him to keep their secret safe. Porchemy of the Bluejam Pirates then came walking through the woods, and as Ace and Sabo hid from him, they left Luffy to be captured. Porchemy took Luffy to his base and interrogated him about the money Ace and Sabo had stolen from his crew. Luffy refused to answer him, even when Porchemy nearly beat him to death with spiked gloves. Ace and Sabo then came to the base and freed Luffy, with Ace beating Porchemy.<br><br>


			After this incident, Luffy, Ace, and Sabo became friends and went on many adventures together, becoming known throughout the Goa Kingdom.Then, as Ace turned 17, he sailed off to sea as a pirate, and a 14-year-old Luffy said goodbye to him. Luffy said goodbye to the Dadan Family and went to Foosha Village to say his goodbyes before setting off three more years later, becoming his own pirate. Luffy used Gomu Gomu no Pistol to knock the Lord of the Coast away as soon as he appeared to challenge him. Luffy had plans to gather ten crew members, acquire a Jolly Roger, and assume the title of Pirate King as they were sailing. </p>

			<h1 id="Arc">Romance Dawn Arc</h1>
			<div class="meet">
			<p>The first thing that Luffy came across on his voyage was a whirlpool, which pulled his ship in. Luffy managed to survive by hiding in a barrel, which washed ashore on Goat Island. The Alvida Pirates' cabin boy Koby rolled the barrel to a storehouse, and some of his crewmates went to open it, causing Luffy to knock them out as he emerged accidentally. Luffy asked Koby for a ship, and Koby gave him a boat he had made to escape, revealing that he was serving the Alvida Pirates against his will but was too afraid to try to get away. Luffy did not think much of Koby's lack of resolve, telling the cabin boy that he intended to become Pirate King. Koby's captain Alvida then came and destroyed the boat, but as she confronted Koby, the cabin boy found the resolve to stand up to her. Luffy was impressed with Koby and intercepted Alvida's attempt to strike Koby with her mace. The mace did not affect Luffy, and he knocked out Alvida with one punch. Luffy then told the Alvida Pirates to get him and Koby a boat, and they complied.<br><br>

			Koby was worried about what might happen to Luffy while they were traveling on the Grand Line, also known as the pirate graveyard. In response, Luffy said he would put together a strong team, starting with the formidable bounty hunter Roronoa Zoro.  They arrived at Shells Town, where Captain Morgan's Marines were imprisoning Zoro, thanks to Koby's navigational prowess. After a meal at a restaurant, Koby and Luffy got ready to part ways at the Marine base. Zoro offered to aid Luffy if he was released when Zoro saw Luffy looking over the wall and seeing him tied up. Then, as Rika, a young child, scaled the wall to give Zoro some rice balls, Luffy and Koby watched. Helmeppo, the son of Morgan, intervened to stop her and had his Marine bodyguards hurl her over the wall. Once Helmeppo's crew left, Luffy captured Rika and scaled the wall to speak with Zoro. Zoro declined to join Luffy's crew, claiming Helmeppo had promised to release him if he could go for a month without food. He nevertheless requested Luffy to give him Rika's rice balls, which Helmeppo had pounded to a pulp, and instructed him to inform Rika of their deliciousness.<br><br>	</p>

			<p>Luffy returned to Shells Town and relayed the message to Rika, and she revealed that Zoro was imprisoned after protecting her from Helmeppo's dog. Helmeppo then came into town and announced to the citizens that Zoro would be executed, and when Luffy questioned his promise, he revealed that it was a lie. Luffy then punched Helmeppo, and as Koby held him back from attacking him more, Helmeppo said his father would get revenge on Luffy. Luffy then went back to the Marine base to recruit Zoro again. When he found out that The Marines had confiscated Zoro's sword, Luffy went to find them and offer to give them back if Zoro joined his crew. Hearing voices on the roof of the base, Luffy stretched his arms and pulled himself up. However, he sent himself flying over the top and grabbed ropes that the Marines were using to erect a statue of Morgan, causing the statue to fall and break. Luffy then captured Helmeppo and ran inside, telling Helmeppo to give him the location of Zoro's sword.Helmeppo did so, and Luffy used him as a shield to keep from being shot by the Marines. Luffy went to Helmeppo's room, where he saw three swords. Seeing Zoro and Koby being confronted by Morgan and the Marines outside, Luffy took all the swords and jumped out the window, intercepting the bullets being shot at Zoro and Koby.<br><br>

			Luffy's rubber body absorbed the bullets and sent them flying back at the Marines. Zoro said that all three of the swords were his, and agreed to join Luffy if they survived this battle. As Luffy tried to untie Zoro, Zoro told him to give him his swords instead. Zoro cut himself free to intercept the charging Marines, and Luffy kicked all of them away. As Morgan told his subordinates to shoot themselves, Luffy attacked the Marine captain and quickly overpowered him. Helmeppo then threatened to shoot Koby, and Luffy turned to attack him, turning his back on Morgan. However, Luffy was able to punch Helmeppo as Zoro cut down Morgan. To the pirates' surprise, the Marines celebrated the defeat of their captain.<br><br>

			Luffy, Zoro, and Koby then went to eat at Rika's family's restaurant, but the Marines came and told them they had to leave. They questioned if Koby was going with them, and Luffy started talking about Koby's past to goad Koby into hitting him. This plan worked, and Koby joined the Marines. As Luffy and Zoro set sail, Koby and the Marines came to the coast and saluted them as thanks for freeing them from Morgan.</p>
			

			<h1 id="arlong">Arlong Park Arc <br>Encounter with the Worst Man of the East Blue</h1>
			<div class="arlong">
			<p>As Yosaku took Luffy and Sanji to Nami's location, he told them about the Seven Warlords of the Sea, one of three organizations with power over the Grand Line. He revealed that one of them, Captain Jinbe of the Fish-Man Pirates, had unleashed a fearsome fish-man known as Arlong into the East Blue, and Nami had likely gone to his base at Arlong Park. Luffy was intrigued to hear of fish-men and drew a picture of what he thought one would look like. As Sanji prepared food for them, the giant sea cow Momoo approached the trio's ship. Luffy punched Momoo to keep it away from their food but only made it mad. Sanji tried to feed Momoo, but then beat the sea cow into submission after it wanted to eat him as well,and so the crew made Momoo pull them to Arlong Park.<br><br>


			Momoo eventually reached Arlong Park and crashed into the shore, sending Luffy, Sanji, and Yosaku flying over the island on their ship. They landed in a clearing and crashed into Zoro in the process, and as the four of them recovered from the landing, Johnny ran toward them and revealed that Nami had killed Usopp. Luffy refused to believe Johnny and was about to attack him when Nami approached them.She confirmed Johnny's report and told the Straw Hats to leave the island, saying she only pretended to be their friend to steal from them for her real captain Arlong. Johnny and Yosaku decided to take her advice and leave, but Luffy chose instead to lie down and take a nap. Sometime later, Usopp came across Luffy's group and revealed that Nami had only pretended to kill him to save his life from Arlong; he believed that Nami had an ulterior motive for working with Arlong. Nami's older sister Nojiko then approached the Straw Hats and told them that they should leave this island, but she offered to explain everything before they did. However, Luffy had no interest in hearing her explanation and so walked away.<br><br></p>

			<p>Luffy walked to Cocoyasi Village, and he watched as Marine 16th Branch Captain Nezumi led a raid on Nami's home to confiscate the money she had stolen. Luffy asked Nami if he could help during the commotion, but she angrily told him she wanted nothing to do with him before running away. Nami later returned to try to stop the villagers from going to attack Arlong, but failed. She then started stabbing her Arlong Pirates tattoo when Luffy grabbed her arm to stop her. Nami tried to get Luffy to leave, but she eventually broke down and asked him to help as he stayed. Luffy accepted this request as he put his straw hat on her head and headed for Arlong Park, and when he reached Zoro, Usopp, and Sanji, they immediately went along with him. Luffy then punched through the gate to Arlong Park and asked which fish-man was Arlong.</p>
			

			<h1 id="destruction">Destruction of Arlong Park</h1>
			<div class="destroy">
			<p>After Arlong identified himself, Luffy beat aside two of his subordinates before punching the fish-man. Hatchan then summoned Momoo to come to their aid, and although the sea cow was afraid of Luffy and Sanji, Arlong intimidated it into attacking. However, Luffy planted his feet in the concrete and grabbed onto Momoo's horns; he then spun it around Arlong Park, taking down several of the Arlong Pirates before hurling the sea cow into the ocean. Luffy was unable to get his feet out of the concrete, though, forcing his crew to protect him and try to pull him out as they fought off the Arlong Pirates. Luffy attempted to punch Arlong but missed, and the fish-man tore off a chunk of the concrete that Luffy was stuck in and threw it into the pool, causing it to pull Luffy to the bottom. Luffy could do nothing but hold his breath and could not hold it for long as he fell unconscious and started swallowing water.<br><br>

			Nojiko and Genzo swam down to Luffy and pulled his head above water before taking turns holding it and pumping his chest to force the swallowed water out. Eventually, Luffy regained consciousness, and Sanji managed to go down and destroy the concrete chunk, causing Luffy's body to fly out of the pool. Luffy pulled himself toward Arlong and punched him with a variety of attacks that inflicted minor damage. Arlong mocked Luffy for his physical inferiority as a human and questioned what skillsets Luffy had in comparison to his crewmates; Luffy simply replied that his skillset was beating Arlong.
			Arlong then attempted to bite Luffy with his powerful teeth, and Luffy tried breaking them only to find that the fish-man could instantly regrow them. Luffy knocked out multiple sets of Arlong's teeth and tried to use them as weapons,but his attempt to bite Arlong did little damage due to his lesser jaw strength. Arlong responded by biting Luffy in the shoulder, but Luffy managed to dislodge the fish-man's jaw by slamming him into the ground, preventing his arm from being bitten off. Arlong then leaped at Luffy multiple times and stabbed him with his hard and sharp nose, but Luffy was eventually able to respond by stretching his fingers into a net around Arlong and slamming him into the ground below. This attack only enraged Arlong, and he rapidly attacked Luffy with his saw-like sword Kiribachi. Arlong's attacks forced Luffy up the tower, and the fish-man eventually hit the pirate through the wall and into a room on an upper level.<br><br></p>

			<p>Arlong revealed that this room was where Nami spent the last eight years making sea charts for him to use to take over the East Blue, and Luffy grew enraged as Arlong spoke of Nami as little more than his property. After shattering one of the blades on Kiribachi, Luffy started destroying the equipment in the room to prevent Nami from ever going there again, knocking them through the walls and causing them to fall to the ground below. Arlong bit Luffy's neck to stop him, but Luffy grabbed his nose and snapped it out of place. He then stretched his leg up and smashed Arlong through the floor with Gomu Gomu no Battle Axe, sending him crashing all the way to the ground and defeating him. The destruction caused by the attack resulted in the tower collapsing, but Luffy emerged from the wreckage victorious and declared that Nami was now his crewmate.
			Nezumi then stepped in with his men to announce that he would be taking the Arlong Pirates' money as well as the credit for their defeat, but the Straw Hats beat them up. As they swam away, Nezumi promised revenge on Luffy. Later, Luffy was with Zoro as the latter had his wound from Mihawk stitched up, and the doctor Nako recommended that they find a doctor for their crew.The pirates and villagers then partied into the night, and Luffy encountered Genzo at a gravesite while looking for a raw ham melon. Genzo made it clear to Luffy that he would kill him if he made Nami stop smiling. On the day of departure, Johnny and Yosaku bid farewell to the Straw Hats as they resumed their lives as bounty hunters. As the Straw Hats waited for Nami to come aboard, she told them to start sailing from the back of the crowd of villagers. She then raced through the crowd and leaped onto the Merry, and Luffy laughed as she revealed that she had pickpocketed the villagers.</p>
