    	 <p>My name is Samuel Simeon and i am a nigerian by Nationality. my hobbies are watching anime which i got my hero from, sleeping(not sure if this is classified as a hobby but i love sleeping), reading comics and i love eating tasty food. i am currently studying at Griffith college, Dublin where i am currently learning computer science. The reason I chose to 
         Write this website about monkey.d.luffy is that, even though luffy is a fictional character he has encouraged me to 
     always be positive and how to forgive and help others. luffy is an amizing character who has turned a lot of his enimies into his allies and make them turn a new leaf. luffy is an exceptional character and i love him very much. Try watching one piece it's a very nice and fun anime.</p>
