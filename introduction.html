    	 	 <p class="first">Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and simply "Straw Hat", is the main character of the manga and anime One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its most powerful fighters. He wants to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thus become the Pirate King, which would help him fulfill an unknown dream he's only told Shanks, his brothers, and crew about. Being the Pirate King, he believes, entails having the most freedom in the world.<br><br><br>

    	 	 Luffy was born in Foosha Village, the son of Revolutionary Army leader Monkey D. Dragon and the grandson of Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, and their family bears the initial and Will of D. Luffy met "Red-Haired" Shanks, who gave him the straw hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, as part of a promise to meet again someday after he became a great pirate. Growing up on Dawn Island, Luffy befriended and married the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, as well as being raised by Curly Dadan.<br><br><br>

             Luffy was 7 years old when he accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which turned his body into rubber. Luffy is able to use the seemingly insignificant abilities of his Devil Fruit to act as an incredibly competent fighter, frequently manipulating his own rubbery body into a variety of powerful forms, thanks to his strong imagination. He is one of the few people known to have awakened his Devil Fruit, which bestows him with mythical power. In addition to his Devil Fruit abilities, Luffy is one of the few people who can wield all three forms of Haki and has mastered them to the point where he has developed advanced abilities.<br><br><br>	

             Luffy has faced numerous global powers, beginning with the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and progressing to clashes with the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the Grand Line, and has emerged victorious in the majority of these battles. He invaded and indirectly destroyed Enies Lobby, escaped the impregnable Impel Down, and was a pivotal figure in the Marineford Summit War. Prior to the organization's dissolution, he also defeated or befriended seven of the eleven known past or present Warlords. Furthermore, Luffy has repeatedly invaded the territory of the Four Emperors, eventually defeating one of them. Luffy's achievements and heritage have earned him the title of "Dangerous Future Element," as well as a reputation for being "reckless" and, in some cases, "insane," earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters, and even the World Government.<br><br><br>	

             Luffy has made tremendous strides in his life of piracy, with his bounty heavily reflecting this fact. He gained his first bounty of  30,000,000 for defeating the strongest pirate captains of the East Blue, which then increased to  100,000,000 after defeating Crocodile in Arabasta. After his crew's invasion into and escape from Enies Lobby, his bounty was increased to  300,000,000. His sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Luffy, along with Zoro to be included among the eleven "Super Rookies," pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over  100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War. He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation.<br><br><br>	

             Two years after the war, with his bounty increased to Beli.png400,000,000, he entered the New World and began challenging the Emperors and their allies directly, with his bounty going up to Beli.png500,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc, and later all the way to Beli.png1,500,000,000 after the global revelation that he is Sabo's brother and the existence of Straw Hat Grand Fleet becoming public, as well as the events of the Whole Cake Island Arc. After leading the Raid on Onigashima and defeating Kaidou, his bounty was increased to Beli.png3,000,000,000.
