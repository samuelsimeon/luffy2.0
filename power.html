    	 	<h4 id="html"><u>Overview</u></h4>
    	 	<p>	As one of the Four Emperors, and at the young age of 19, Luffy is one of the four most powerful pirates in the world. He captains the Straw Hat Pirates, holding the greatest authority over a mighty and diverse crew consisting of several infamous members, many of whom are extremely powerful in their own right. Luffy has a tremendous amount of influence over his crewmates, so much so that they all trust him with their lives, despite his reckless behavior and, in some cases, even because of it.

    	 	He is also one of the 12 pirates known as the "Worst Generation," a group of people whose crimes against the World Government have made them famous. Each of them has a bounty of more than Beli 100,000,000. He indirectly also has control over the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, a sizable fleet made up of seven strong New World crews, totaling 5640 individuals, who have all sworn to serve him and come to his aid whenever he may need them.The scope of Luffy's authority is considered by the World Government to be close to on par with the Four Emperors, the four most powerful and influential pirates in the world, and the press dubbed Luffy the "Fifth Emperor" as a result.<br><br><br>

    	 	Since he was a little boy, Luffy has undergone tough and demanding training. He is a ferocious and deadly combatant who can devise incredibly inventive fighting methods even in the middle of a heated mid-battle. Silvers Rayleigh, the former first mate of the Pirate King's crew, and his grandpa Monkey D. Garp, the "Hero of the Marines," were two renowned men who educated him. While sometimes appearing silly and quirky, Luffy has shown himself to be a natural leader.

    	 	One of Luffy's best traits is his ability to increase his power by an unimaginably large amount in a very short period of time. Luffy has consistently defeated opponents who are renowned throughout the seas for their amazing power and ability, much to the surprise of both friends and enemies. By eliminating three of the Seven Warlords of the Sea—Crocodile, Gecko Moria, and Donquixote Doflamingo—and forging alliances with two others, Luffy has also gravely endangered the equilibrium of the Three Great Powers and led to the defection of Jinbe and the loss of Trafalgar Law. [40] The fact that Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the commander of the Revolutionary Army, is another reason why the World Government sees him as a serious threat.
    	 	</p>
    	 	<h4 id="physical"><u>Physical Abilities</u></h4>
    	 	<p>
    	 		Contrary to what his size would suggest, and even without his Devil Fruit powers or Haki, Luffy has strength, speed, agility, durability, endurance and vitality that are the stuff of legends; ranging from accomplishing feats that would be physically impossible for a normal human to achieve and surviving dangers that most would think impossible to survive.
    	 	</p>
    	 	<h4 id="https"><u>Strength</u></h4>
    	 	<div class="strength">
    	 	<p>
    	 		His grandfather Garp used harsh and unorthodox training methods to make him grow stronger, such as leaving him alone in the wilderness as a young child, tying him to balloons so he would float away, or throwing him into a bottomless pit, as well as several years of further rigorous training in the extremely harsh environments of Mt. Colubo and Rusukaina. By the time he began his quest to become Pirate King, Luffy had attained incredible physical strength, which he demonstrated by knocking out the Lord of the Coast with a single punch. In Skypiea, he was capable of moving around during his fight against Enel despite having a massive golden ball molded around his hand, and even climbed up a massive beanstalk with it. When caught between two large brick buildings in Water 7, he was eventually able to push them apart to free himself. Even in a severely weakened state after his calamitous battles at Impel Down and Marineford, Luffy was still able to cause massive destruction on Amazon Lily and hurl a boulder several times larger than himself with enough force to destroy a nearby rock formation.[49] Despite these feats, however, his strength still paled in comparison to certain other powerful characters at the time, such as several participants in the Summit War of Marineford.</p>

				    </figure>
			</div>
			<p> Luffy's strength appeared to have increased dramatically after two years of training with Rayleigh in Rusukaina. He was initially at the mercy of every animal on the island, but after several months of training, he became their official boss. Other examples include when he easily defeated a Pacifista with a single punch, whereas it took him and his entire crew two years prior. Without any leverage, he easily flipped over the massive gladiator Spartan and used his foot to block a stomp by Donquixote Doflamingo, a man nearly twice his height with immense physical power of his own.
				Luffy has used his Gears, which are transformation techniques enabled by his Devil Fruit powers, to greatly increase his physical strength and subdue formidable opponents such as Blueno, Rob Lucci, and Donquixote Doflamingo. He defeated the powerful giant Hajrudin with a single Gear 2 punch to the face two years later, after taking out a member of the Marines' Giant Squad with a single Gear 3 punch.  The Sea Kings on Fish-Man Island believed he would have completely destroyed the massive ship Noah before it arrived if they hadn't intervened. Luffy was capable of annihilating an entire town with a single, enhanced Gear 4 punch.

    	 		Luffy can also become physically stronger through psychology. Luffy went on a rampage through the Black Cat Pirates, ripping the stem and figurehead off their ship after Jango accidentally hypnotized him to make him stronger. Luffy attempted to increase his fighting prowess by donning an afro during the Davy Back Fight battle against Foxy.
			</p>
    	 	<h4 id="huge">Speed and Agility</h4>
    	 	<p>
    	 		After his two-year training, he has been able to dodge attacks even while using Gear 3. He was able to avoid being attacked by Cavendish in the Corrida Colosseum by dodging the pirate's sword strikes and clasping the sword with his hands.[60] Against Charlotte Katakuri, he showed the ability to dodge a considerable amount of the Sweet Commander's strikes, as well as all of Katakuri's attacks with his trident Mogura (barring one in which Luffy was impaired by Flampe's dart), despite Katakuri being able to foresee his movements. Luffy being able to see into the future with his Kenbunshoku Haki aids his dodging ability considerably, and during his fight with Kaidou on Onigashima, Luffy managed to partially dodge Kaidou's Raimei Hakke attack despite the Emperor being capable of moving at near-blinding speed; earlier, Luffy had been powerless to avoid that strike.
    	 	</p>
    	 	<h4 id="hook">Durability</h4>
    	 	<p>
    	 		Luffy has demonstrated the capacity to withstand extreme physical abuse while remaining aware and capable of fighting. When he was younger, Luffy was beaten severely with Porchemy's spiky gloves in an effort to get information from him, but He endured the torture without divulging anything. was poisoned in the Arabasta Kingdom by the poison hook of the crocodile, yet he survived long enough to slay the Warlord. Foxy's spiked gloves hit him several times, yet he didn't lose his balance. Wyper's Burn Bazooka directly struck Luffy on Upper Yard, destroying a huge hole in a huge tree, yet all it did was cause him to begin bleeding.Most notably, Luffy was able to remain upright until Charlotte Katakuri was knocked out of his fight with her in the Mirro-World despite fighting for more than nine hours and taking many more hits than he did. This included being horrifyingly impaled in the side by Katakuri's trident Mogura. The Emperor's might was so great during his first battle with Kaidou that he could kill Luffy with a single blow with his mace;However even after being partially struck by the same attack, Luffy was able to escape the Prisoner Mine training session and face Kaidou once again unharmed. [44] He eventually learns to withstand Kaidou's blows without passing out.<br><br><br>

    	 		After surviving being poisoned by Magellan, Luffy developed an immunity to most poisons, causing him to be unaffected when Caesar Clown attacked him with poisonous gases.[69] However, he did later fall victim to poison after consuming the skin of the Armored Stonefish; though the skin normally causes instant death, Luffy's poison resistance merely put him in a coma.[70] Despite that incident, he seems to be quite proud of his immunity. When he witnessed Queen's Excite Bullets, he claimed they would not work on him.[71] However, Chopper needed to treat him later on. 
    	 	</p>
    	 	<h4 id="hit">Endurance</h4>
    	 	<p>
    	 		Luffy possesses immense endurance stemming from his great durability and willpower. As a child, he developed endurance when his grandfather put him through various training methods. When following Ace on a long and dangerous trek from Mt. Colubo to Gray Terminal, as he accompanied Ace and Sabo on their adventures through the wilderness.By far his most noteworthy feat was surviving exposure to an incurable amount of poison after fighting Magellan in Impel Down. When brought before Emporio Ivankov, Luffy was given hormones to give him the chance to fight for his life for two and a half days at the cost of his lifespan. He not only successfully fought to stay alive but returned to consciousness in just 20 hours. By doing this, he proved his connection to his father who has a similar will.With the help of Ivankov's Tension Hormones and his willpower, Luffy was able to keep fighting through Impel Down immediately after his near-death experience and continued fighting at Marineford with little rest in between until his body eventually gave out after he failed to save Ace from death.<br><br><br>

    	 		In Enies Lobby, Luffy pulled off another feat of endurance, as although he quickly pushed his limits by repeatedly using Gear 2 and Gear 3, and was heavily injured by Lucci's Rokuogan attacks, he was able to keep fighting until he had defeated Lucci. Luffy also demonstrated his endurance at Whole Cake Island, as he battled Charlotte Cracker for 11 hours without resting, using Gear 4 at least twice.He then proceeded to get heavily beaten by his crewmate Sanji, but when a Big Mom Pirates army arrived soon after to take him down, Luffy fought hard for a considerable period of time, before ultimately being knocked out.After being temporarily frozen in time in a book prison, Luffy singlehandedly made his way out of the Whole Cake Chateau and beat up every enemy he encountered, despite still being extremely weak from fatigue and hunger, the latter of which he refused to address until Sanji returned to him.<br><br><br>
    	 	</p>
    	 	<h4 id="headbutt">Instinct</h4>
    	 	<p>
    	 		Luffy is typically prone to making poor choices. But when he's fighting, he has an intuitive instinct that has frequently led to him taking unusual acts that end up being beneficial to him. On Little Garden, where there were several copies of Mr. 3, Luffy was immediately able to identify and assault the genuine article thanks only to instinct.During battling Arlong, Luffy's arm was bit, but instead of trying to pull it out, he bashed the fish-head man's into the ground to dislodge its mouth, saving his arm. Luffy employed techniques like closing his mind and shooting his punches off walls to ricochet them randomly in order to defeat Enel anticipating his assaults with Mantra, and it worked. By devouring the Sweet Commander's never-ending concoctions of biscuits, Luffy taxed Cracker's strength.<br><br><br>

    	 		Luffy also possesses tremendous creativity, and frequently comes up with unusual methods to get ahead in a fight. In his first fight with Crocodile, Luffy noticed that he could make his opponent's body tangible with liquid, and before their second fight he consumed large quantities of water to use against the Warlord. He took it a step further in their third and final fight by using his blood as the liquid. When possible, Luffy likes to power himself up with outside objects and often uses things from the enemy against them. He knocked out sets of Arlong's teeth and tried to use them, although was not particularly successful. When Mr. 3 bound his arms and legs with candle-shaped wax bindings, Luffy immediately began using these bindings as powerful blunt weapons to demolish Mr. 3's other wax creations. When he became allies with Mr. 3 in Impel Down, Luffy requested that he be powered up with the wax once again to fight Magellan, and he was successfully able to hit the warden without being poisoned.
    	 	</p>
    	 	<h4 id="devilfruit">Devil Fruit</h4>
    	 	<div class="fruit">
    	 	<p>
    	 		Luffy unwittingly ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit, when he was 7 years old after discovering it in a chest owned by the Red Hair Pirates. It gives his body rubber-like properties, allowing him to stretch, bounce, bend, twist, and inflate any part of his body. [100] Luffy was initially unable to control his stretching[101], but after ten years of training on Dawn Island, he was able to master it, and further master it during the two years he spent training with Silvers Rayleigh on Rusukaina.<br><br><br>


    	 		The Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, which lets the user to become an incarnation of Nika, an ever-playful Sun God known for freeing slaves and making people smile, was revealed to be a Legendary Zoan-type Devil Fruit during the Wano County Arc. As long as he can picture it, Luffy can fight anyway he wants because this gives his body a rubber physiology. The Five Elders claim that Nika is referred to as the "Warrior of Liberation" and that "there is no power more absurd in all the universe" because of the grins he can bring to other people's faces.

    	 		Luffy is completely immune to lightning because he is made of rubber. He is also immune to blunt attacks that are not imbued with Busoshoku Haki, such as punches, blunt weapons, and even being stepped on by massive opponents. When hit by blunt projectiles like bullets or cannonballs, he can bounce them back toward the source, potentially endangering the person who launched it</p>
    	 	<figure> <img src="images/g2.png" width="300" height="240" alt="A picture of luffy" >

			    </figure>
    	 </div>
    	 	    <p>He can also survive falls from great heights with ease.
    	 		Any portion of his body can be stretched; for example, he can stretch his arms to increase the range of his punches, his legs to increase the range of his kicks, and his neck to increase the range of his headbutt. Using his reaching to take hold of something nearby and pull himself there, he can also reach far locations. He can increase the force of his attacks by spinning and twirling certain body parts. 

    	 		Over the course of his voyage in the Grand Line, he developed techniques he calls Gears to utilize his Devil Fruit to combat stronger opponents, such as speeding up his own blood flow to increase his speed or enlarging his bones and muscles for more powerful strikes. During his training on Rukuskaina, he learned how to combine his Haki with his rubber abilities, making his already destructive attacks inconceivably faster and stronger. 
    	 	</p>
    	 	<h4 id="gear2">Gear2</h4>
    	 	 	<div class="gear2">
    	 	<p>
    	 		Enies Lobby was where Gear 2 originally appeared. Luffy speeds up his blood flow, and because his organs and blood veins are made of rubber, his body can bear the strain. This enables his body to be supplied with more oxygen and nutrients. Luffy's physical powers are substantially enhanced by Gear 2, enabling him to easily outpace Soru users' movement speed and destroy the Tekkai's defensive power.<br><br><br>

    	 		After the time skip, Luffy has demonstrated that he has more control over it and can activate it in any specific portion of his body. Initially, he did this by pumping blood via his legs to activate the effect across his entire body. Prior to his two-year training, using Gear 2 swiftly depleted his energy and even put his life in danger, but its effects today seem to be less severe.
    	 	</p>

			    </figure>

			     </div>
    	 	<h4 id="gear3">Gear3</h4>
    	 	<p>
    	 		Enies Lobby was where Gear 3 originally appeared. Luffy has the ability to make a particular part of his body enormous by blowing a great deal of air into his thumb and expanding the bones there. As Luffy learnt to employ Busoshoku Haki during the time skip and Haoshoku Haki infusion during the Wano Country Arc, the power of these inflated body parts increased to the point that they could easily destroy steel doors and big structures.<br><br><br>

    	 		Initially, Gear 3 would cause Luffy to shrink to the size of a child after its use, temporarily limiting his fighting capabilities until his body returned to normal.However, this no longer happens after Luffy's two years of training.
    	 	</p>
    	 	<figure> <img src="images/trans4.jpg" width="300" height="240"  alt="gear 3" >

			    </figure>
    	 	<h4 id="gear4">Gear4</h4>
    	 	<div class="gear4">
    	 	<p>
    	 		Gear 4 was developed throughout the course of Luffy's two years of training on Rusukaina and debuted on Dressrosa. Luffy can assume one of three forms by blowing into his arm, inflating his entire body's muscles, and covering it with Busoshoku Haki. Boundman's first form makes his body resemble a rubber ball, causing him to bounce constantly. In addition to releasing powerful blows and changing the direction of his assaults, Luffy has the ability to retract his arms and legs inside of his body. His defense also improves since most assaults are deflected away by his body.<br><br><br>

    	 		The second form, Tankman, enlarges Luffy and strengthens his defenses, enabling him to use his body as a weapon by blasting opponents away during the recoil from assaults. With less bulk and a stronger emphasis on offense than the other two forms, Snakeman is the third form. With a significant increase in attack speed, Luffy frequently adjusts the direction of his attacks in order to hit his opponents from all sides.However, in addition to being weakened, he will be unable to use Haki for ten minutes until it recharges.Using Gear 4 multiple times in a short amount of time will take a toll on his body.<a href="gallery.html">Click here </a></li> to see all Gear 4 forms.

			    </figure>
    	 </div>
    	 	<h4 id="haki">Haki</h4>
    	 	<p>
    	 		Only Luffy and Kaidou have demonstrated the advanced use of each of the three forms of Haki, making him one of the few people in the entire world who is able to do so. In particular, Silvers Rayleigh, Gol D. Roger's former first mate and right-hand man, taught him during the two-year time skip and said that he has a noteworthy knack for haki, having mastered the fundamentals of all forms in just one and a half years.
    	 	</p>
    	 	<h4>Haoshoku Haki</h4>
    	 	<p>
    	 		Haoshoku Haki is a very uncommon sort of Haki, whose users are supposed to possess kingly traits, and Luffy is an extremely proficient user of it. It remained dormant within him until he unintentionally used it numerous times, including to stop Motobaro, the bison of the Rosy Life Riders, to stop Sandersonia from killing a petrified Marguerite at Amazon Lily's arena, to knock out several Kuja warriors on Level 5 of Impel Down, to knock out charging wolves at Marineford, to knock out Galdino and an executioner, as well as several elite Marines and New World pirates.<br>

    	 		<figure> <img src="images/g3.jpeg" width="500" height="240"  alt="Gear 4 BounceMan" >

			    </figure>

    	 		Rayleigh taught him about Haoshoku Haki throughout the two-year gap in time, giving him conscious control over it and making him an expert in the subject. Then, without harming innocent bystanders, he knocked out members of the Fake Straw Hat Crew. He instantly killed 50,000 members of the New Fish-Man Pirates on Fish-Man Island. He battled against other Haoshoku Haki users Charlotte Katakuri, Donquixote Doflamingo, and Chinjao, and their battles produced a striking effect resembling lightning.His remarkable skill is further demonstrated by the fact that Luffy employed Haoshoku Haki while he was incapacitated, such as after Kaidou knocked him out, to defeat members of the Beasts Pirates who attempted to arrest him.
    	 	</p>
    	 	<h4>Busoshoku Haki</h4>
    	 	<div class="haki1">
    	 	<p>
    	 		During the two-year time skip, Luffy learnt Busoshoku Haki from Silvers Rayleigh and became into a very skilled practitioner. Since then, he has used it in battle in the New World to boost his offense and defense as well as his ability to touch and harm Logia users like Caesar Clown and those with features like them like Charlotte Katakuri, a Special Paramecia user.Busoshoku Haki has been a huge help to Luffy in the New World because it allows him to fight and inflict damage on far stronger opponents than he previously could.The most notable instance of this is when he employs Gear 4, which depends on Buoshoku Haki; when compressed, Haki creates a coating that resembles flames. Despite his excessive use of Gear 4, his offense and defenses have improved to the point that he can damage and defend himself against strong foes like Doflamingo, Cracker, and Katakuri, which he couldn't defeat without using Gear 4. As seen on Nuts Island, where he couldn't punch through Perospero's Candy Wall even with Gear 3, Luffy was unable to combat those same foes once his Haki had been misused while it was recharging.
    	 	</p>

    	 		<figure> <img src="images/g4.jpeg" width="360" height="240"  alt="Gear 4 BounceMan" >

			    </figure>

    	 </div>
    	 	<h4>Kenbunshoku Haki(Observation Haki)</h4>
    	 	<p>
    	 		Luffy learnt to utilize Kenbunshoku Haki during the two-year time skip, and he is a very good user of it. He can sense the presence, emotion, and intent of others with it, which substantially aids his abilities to avoid strikes like gunshots. Rayleigh saw that Luffy was exceptionally skilled at detecting the emotions of living things during his two years of training. He is quite good at using this, Haki; he can even anticipate assaults from creatures with little to no emotion, as evidenced by the Pacifista's laser that he avoided. He also nonchalantly avoided a hail of water droplets thrown by Hody Jones and volleys of weaponry thrown by master marksman Jean Ango.
